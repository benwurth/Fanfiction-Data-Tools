Documentation
-------------

Not a lot of documentation so far. You can find out what most tools do by either looking at the comments in the code or by looking at their entries in the Wiki on GitHub.


Word_Counter.py
---------------
Word_Counter.py can be found under the Wordcount folder. Run Word_Counter.py in the terminal with `python Word_Counter.py`. Alternately, you can use the Python Launcher to run the script.

Word_Counter.py will ask you for a text file to parse and then it will begin counting. After it's done, it will ask you for a location to save the CSV file it's produced. After it's written the CSV, you can use it with other tools to produce visualizations.
